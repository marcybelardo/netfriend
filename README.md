netfriend

single-header network library for quick and easy connections!

USAGE

I'm a big fan of the stb image libraries, so I've used a similar structure. Put the header file in your project, and use the appropriate macro to enable the function definitions. Like so,

```c
#define NETFRIEND_IMPL
#include "netfriend.h"
```

Go give the [stb libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb) a look! They are nice.
